**P2P whispering gophers chat client tutorial implementation**

[![Chat Client Program Description](http://whispering-gophers.appspot.com/talk/img/diag-part7.png)](http://whispering-gophers.appspot.com/talk.slide)

This code is my implementation of the "whispernet" tutorial by Andrew Gerrand and Francesc Campoy which can be found at [http://whispering-gophers.appspot.com/talk.slide](http://whispering-gophers.appspot.com/talk.slide). The goal of the tutorial is to demonstrate network programming with Go, and to allow me to compare gRPC and ZMQ with plain vanilla network programming in Go. By running this code a peer-to-peer mesh network for transmitting text messages is created.
